#Input

#n_samples: The total number of points equally divided among clusters.
#Value will be: 5000
#centers: The number of centers to generate, or the fixed center locations.
#Value will be: [[4, 4], [-2, -1], [2, -3],[1,1]]
#cluster_std: The standard deviation of the clusters.
#Value will be: 0.9

#Output
#X: Array of shape [n_samples, n_features]. (Feature Matrix)
#The generated samples.
#y: Array of shape [n_samples]. (Response Vector)
#The integer labels for cluster membership of each sample.

X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=5000, centers=[[4,4], [-2, -1], [2, -3], [1, 1]], cluster_std=0.9)

#The KMeans class has many parameters that can be used, but we will be using these three:

#init: Initialization method of the centroids.
#Value will be: "k-means++"
#k-means++: Selects initial cluster centers for k-mean clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence.
#n_clusters: The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate.
#Value will be: 4 (since we have 4 centers)
#n_init: Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.
#Value will be: 12
#Initialize KMeans with these parameters, where the output parameter is called k_means.
